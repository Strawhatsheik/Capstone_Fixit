Fix It! was my final project for GRA 211: Interactive Animation, which I took in March and April of 2020. I planned through and considered several different story ideas, eventually selecting a concept I was very familiar with: computer and hardware work. Besides software skills, I am well versed in computer hardware and the IT field. My sister’s laptop was always breaking and I was constantly replacing pieces for her, so the idea for Fix It! was born. It would be a multi-choice type game, each choice being a pick of different computer tools and leading to an animation. The goal would be to help the user fix her computer. It would feature an opening and closing animation, a multi-choice story line, and menus for starting the game (with the control instructions), game overs, and a successful finish.

One aspect of programing this game was keeping track of the multiple choices and the scenes that corresponded to them. I drew out the storyboard and labeled all the options as I went. I used Adobe Animate’s ‘label’ feature on the timeline to further mark the beginning and ending sequences. I progressed in this project in leaps and bounds, as I went from zero animation experience to a full game. I mastered gradients and used them to make the tools appear more substantial or three dimensional. I discovered how to display text and images programmatically, enabling me to have a ‘facebox’ for the characters face and for it to change expression, while there was also a textbox to display her narration. By doing these programmatically, as opposed to animating on the timeline, I didn’t have to render the text or faces of each scene continuously. I also learned how to use tweens to help with the longer animations and learned how to animate objects separately from the main canvas. The flipping computer is one such object. It moves independently of the scene itself.

 My initial plan for the game was much longer, with more choices for the user,  including a humorous scene where the user gets electrocuted if she’s not grounded with her static band and uses the screwdriver on the laptop. However, I was forced to scale the project back to fit within the time frame of my class schedule.​​​​​​ I am still pleased to have this game in my portfolio. It is a complete game and has several interesting features. The opening and closing animation have sound effects, recorded by me as well.  It's humorous while still describing how computers work and what the tools are and do. Further, not being an animator, I am really happy with the animations. The tool movement is especially well done and the tools themselves look amazing. In this project I utilized and gained experience with Adobe Animate, Adobe After Effects, ActionScript 3.0, scene and object use, frame by frame animation, as well as tween animation, user input and output, graphical design in the menus, and the ability to export and create a workable .exe file.

 I had a lot of fun with this one! Feel free to look at it on my Behance, there's even a video: https://www.behance.net/gallery/128619521/Fix-It
